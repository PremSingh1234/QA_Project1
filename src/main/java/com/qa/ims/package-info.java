/**
 * This package is the parent of the ims project.
 * Firstly it would run MyIms class, this would create a username and password for the database so a user would have to enter them before connecting to the database,
 * otherwise it wont let you use any of the controllers. 
 * Also it would create a defualt output asking which controller you would like to use and what you would like to do with that controller. 
 * Secondly it would run Runner class, this would show all classes running asking what the user would like to do and depending on what the user inputs it will show in the database.
